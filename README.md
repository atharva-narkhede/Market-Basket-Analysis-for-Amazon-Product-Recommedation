# Market-Basket-Analysis-for-Amazon-Product-Recommendation

Conducted Market Basket Analysis (MBA) on Amazon product dataset to enhance recommendations. Identified top-selling products and top products in each category using review count. Implemented association rule mining for personalized recommendations. Evaluated effectiveness through metrics.

## Overview

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to uncover associations between products purchased together by customers. In this project, we utilize MBA to identify patterns in Amazon product purchases, allowing us to generate personalized product recommendations for customers based on their shopping history.

## Dataset

Amazon product dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset)

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection**: Transactional data including user IDs, product IDs, and quantities purchased.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values.
3. **Data Transformation**: Converting data into transaction-level and basket-level formats.
4. **Data Encoding**: One-hot encoding for categorical variables.
5. **Transaction Filtering**: Removing low-support and irrelevant items.
6. **Association Rule Mining**: Using Apriori or FP-Growth algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Summary Statistics
- Distribution of Numerical Variables
